        <p>Texas is a state in the southern United States. It is the second largest state in the U.S. by both area and population. Known for its diverse landscapes, Texas is home to deserts, pine forests, and coastline along the Gulf of Mexico. It is also known for its rich history, vibrant culture, and contributions to music, food, and business. Austin is the state capital, while Houston is the largest city. Texas is often referred to as the Lone Star State, a nickname that originated from the lone star on its flag, which symbolizes its former status as an independent republic.</p>
